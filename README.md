Checks inventory of Fujifilm X100v on B&amp;H's website

The Fuji X100V is a highly sought after camera within the photography community, specifically sought after by me. I owned this camera, sold it for a profit soon after purchasing, but have regretted it ever since considering I can no longer find it in stock. This is when I thought of this idea.

I used selenium and python to quickly access the B&H website where the Fuji Camera is listed. My program, when ran in the terminal, automatically navigates to B&H's website and outputs the stock status of this camera to the terminal. A real world solution to something I found myself doing each day, checking the camera's inventory. Luckily, selenium makes this task much simpler.
